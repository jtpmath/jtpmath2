# Algebras


If you thought measures were confusing. It gets worse. 

And I don't even think measures are confusing. They're just hard. 

I'm not going to pretend that algebra is any easier. It's actually definitely not. 

But construct a short exact sequence and then measure how far off you are from being exact... 

Wait. I shouldn't be talking about complex analysis yet.
